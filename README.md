In this project, our aim here wasn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but rather to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.

There are many elements on the YouTube page which are produced with Javascript but our objective in this project wasn't to give this page functionality, so except from the video, nothing nothing else is clickable.

## Built with
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Lint
  * Stickler

## Live demo

## Getting started
**For this project, you’ll try your best to recreate the youtube web page. The main aim is to ensure the elements get placed and styled roughly the same way as the youtube page, so functionality is not a priority.**

Use the browser’s developer tools to inspect the real youtube page to understand how elements are placed and styled. 
Build your own page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out.
  - First setup a github repository for your project.
  - Then create a .html file where all your HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all your styling code will reside
  - Then open the youtube web page, inspect its features with your browser's developer tools and start creating  :shipit:
